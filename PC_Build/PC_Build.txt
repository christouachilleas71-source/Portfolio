Custom PC Build 💻⚡

At the age of 13, I built my very first fully functioning computer — completely on my own, with zero help from anyone, not even YouTube. In just 30 minutes, I assembled all the components, booted it for the first time, and it worked perfectly on the first try. After that, I upgraded the CPU, cooler, and PSU, and even updated the BIOS to the latest version, all independently.

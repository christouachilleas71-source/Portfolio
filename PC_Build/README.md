# Custom PC Build 💻⚡

I built my very first fully functioning computer at **13 years old** — completely on my own. No help from anyone, not even YouTube. In just **30 minutes**, I assembled all the components, booted it for the first time, and it worked perfectly on the first try.  

After that, I upgraded the **CPU, cooler, and PSU**, overclocked and undervolted my CPU and GPU and even updated the BIOS to the latest version — all independently.  

This project taught me a lot about **hardware, troubleshooting, and thinking through problems**. It was the moment I realized I could tackle real engineering projects on my own.

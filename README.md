## 🚀 Projects

### 🤖 Intelligent Trash Can
A smart trash can made out of a Kypruino Uno+ board (Arduino Uno) which is the main controller for the smart trash can, 2 servo motors that help move the lid of the trash can and the plate inside, a breadboard to make the connections more tidied, an 0.91' OLED screen to describe what material is the rubbish made out of , an ultrasonic sensor that detects when a hand is directly in front of it , an led to blink whenever the ultrasonic sensor detects something and a laptop's camera (built in) to detect which material is the trash made out of and then order the servo motor that's glued to the plate inside of the bin to move accordingly in the right bin and drop the trash inside it.

🛠 **Technology:** Arduino • Motors • Sensors • C++
